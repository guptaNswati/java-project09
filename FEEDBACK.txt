FEEDBACK:

Overall, excellent job this quarter!


Good extensive testing of various limits.

	Yes, in the relatively small array size of 40K elements, the impact of recursion-limit is less evident
	and the skew in run time is most likely due to background applications, processes etc.


+1 Excellent breakdown of different array size ranges and analysis of the patterns!

-Bita.
